Picturelm
=========

Picturelm is an image gallery frontend written in Elm.


If you get a fancy build error regarding something with a map,
disable debug build mode for elm in parcel using the following:

Find ``options.debug`` and set it to ``false`` somewhere in
``node_modules/parcel-bundler/src/assets/ElmAsset.js``
